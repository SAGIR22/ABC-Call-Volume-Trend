# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend
Observed call distribution and proposed a manpower plan to reduce the abandoned call rate to 10%.

## ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis
-By Sagir Mehmood

### Project Description:
•	This is a dataset of a Customer Experience (CX) Inbound calling team for 23 days of ABC Insurance company. Data includes Agent_Name, Agent_ID, Queue_Time [duration for which customers have to wait before they get connected to an agent], Time [time at which a call was made by a customer in a day], Time_Bucket [for easiness we have also provided you with the time bucket], Duration [duration for which a customer and executives are on call], call status (Abandon, answered, transferred).
•	A customer experience (CX) team is made up of experts who examine data and consumer input before sharing their findings with the rest of the company. The roles and responsibilities that these teams typically carry out include Customer experience programs (CX programs), Digital customer experience, Design and processes, Internal communications, Voice of the customer (VoC), User experiences, Customer experience management, Journey mapping, Nurturing customer interactions, Customer Success, Customer support, Handling Customer Data, and Learning about the Customer Journey
### Objectives :
•	A. Calculate the average call time duration for all incoming calls received by agents (in each Time_Bucket).
•	B. Calculate the average call time duration for all incoming calls received by agents (in each Time_Bucket). Show the total volume/ number of calls coming in via charts/ graphs [Number of calls v/s Time]. You can select the time in a bucket form (i.e. 1-2, 2-3, …..)
•	C. As you can see current abandon rate is approximately 30%. Propose a manpower plan required during each time bucket [between 9 am to 9 pm] to reduce the abandon rate to 10%. (i.e. You have to calculate the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket so that at least 90 calls should be answered out of 100.)
•	D. Let’s say customers also call this ABC insurance company at night but didn’t get an answer as there are no agents to answer, this creates a bad customer experience for this Insurance company. Suppose for every 100 calls that the customer made from 9 Am to 9 Pm, a customer also made 30 calls in the night between interval [9 Pm to 9 Am] and the distribution of those 30 calls are as follows:

 Now propose a manpower plan required during each time bucket in a day. The maximum Abandon rate assumption would be the same 10%.
